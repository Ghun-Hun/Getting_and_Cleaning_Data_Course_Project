# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Overview
 
  * The purpose of this project is to pratice to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.The data in this project was obtained at The UCI Machine Learning Repository:
  
  * http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

### Project Summary

  * The Project have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the project data is in your working directory.This R script dose following:
  
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data called tidy_data.txt that set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subjec


### The Project includes the following files:
  
  * README.md: 
  
  * CodeBook.md: describing the variables in this project.

  * run_analysis.R: clean a data set at The UCI Machine Learning Repository and produce tidy data for this   project specific.
  
  
  * tidy_data.txt:  tidy data set for this project.
